# Postgame

This stage displays the results for the current round played. The `Host` reads the results while the results are hidden from the `Player`s visually. `Player`s must listen to the `Host`. Then the `Host` reveals the results by clicking a button. The `Host` can then choose to play a new round, go to the Finale, or pick a new `Host`.
