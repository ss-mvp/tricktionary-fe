# Components

This folder contains two directories that split our component architecture into two distinct groups: Common components and Page components.

## Common Components

These are meant to be fairly non-specialized so that they can be used in various places across the application.

## Page Components

These components are the larger-overarching page structure of our application. These are components that cannot be re-used as they are highly specialized, and are the components that will generally be rendered by the router.
